 # Summary
 ---
 ## Drawback
- Webpage is not very interactive 

## Recommendations
- Add light theme and toggle button for user to switch between the themes 
- Add a list of cities, state, Country and shape as a dropdown in filter for user to select, as it would be easy to select rather than input the value, so that user can easily search on the value available
